   :alt: A DFA with two states: a and b. The initial and final state is a. The alphabet is the digits 0 to 9. All 0s and 5s go to state a and all other digits go to state b for both nodes.

Example 2
^^^^^^^^^

Recognises the language of words over the alphabet {0, 1}
which contain exactly two 1s

   :alt: A chain of four nodes, the first is the initial and the third is the final state. Each node has a transition to itself with the word "0", and a transition to the next node with the word "1", except the last where both 0 and one transition to itself.
